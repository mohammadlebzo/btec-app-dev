# Project-Tools
## Stage 1, Task 2

1.	
- ***Visual Studio Code(vs code)***: **vs code** is an *IDE* used to develop programs using varies programming languages, it offers many powerful tools, such as **IntelliSense code completion** and **debugging**, it is also has a great range of accessibility as it is available on *Windows*, *macOS* and *Linux*, and last but not least it can provides integration with *version control systems* such as git.

- ***PyCharm***: it is an *IDE* developed by **JetBrains**, used to develop programs using varies programming languages but it’s specifically used for **python**, as it offers a **graphical debugger, code analysis**, integration with *version control systems* and **support for web development**, it is also available on *Windows*, *macOS* and *Linux* which allows developers to keep working cross-platforms, removing accessibility barriers.

- ***Linux***: it is an **opensource** *operating system* which manages communication between the software and the hardware’s resources. **Linux** is cost free, trouble free, incredibly reliable operating system. **Linux** is generally far less vulnerable to any malware or viruses attacks.
**Note**: **Linux** is mostly used by developers, its more of a professional, developer friendly environment.

- ***Windows***: it is a **paid** *operating system* which manages communication between the software and the hardware’s resources. **Windows** is a wildly used *operating system*, that’s all thanks to it’s casual friendly environment, as anyone can pick windows and understand it’s environment very easily, but that doesn’t mean that it isn’t good for professional use. **Windows** offers a wide variety of programs because of it’s popularity and spread.

- ***GitHub***: it is a **website and cloud-based service**, that is used by most developers all over the world, because it allows developers to *store*, *manage*, *track* and *control* their code using **git**(**git** is a *version control system*).

- ***GitLab***: it is an **opensource, open core web-based DevOps lifecycle tool** created by Ukrainian developers Dmitriy Zaporozhets and Valery Sizov that provides **git repository manager**(a form of *version control systems*).

**Now** as for my choice of tools for this project, i will be using the following tools:
- ***Visual Studio Code(vs code)*** as an *IDE*.
- ***Linux*** as an *operating system*.
- ***GitHub*** as a *version control system*.


2. I will be explaining now why i chose these tools: 

- ***Visual Studio Code(vs code)***: i have chose this *IDE* because of: also because of its excellent speed and preformance.
    - The *wide variety of tools* that this *IDE* offers, such as the **git integration** and **live web service** to name a few.

    - **JavaScript** and **web application development** support.
    - **Cost free** use.
    - **Excellent speed and preformance**.
    - **personal preference**.

- ***Linux***: i have chose this *operating system* because:
    - This *operating system* is an **open source** meaning it **cost free**.

    - **Great security**.
    - This *operating system* has the **terminal** by default which is a major part of using the **git** *version control system*

    - Continuous  support from it's community.
    - Support for the **git** *version control system* and the **VS code** *IDE*.

- ***GitHub***: i have chose this *version control system* to be able to:
    - Have a history of all of the versions of the project for better **problem solving** and **management** for the project.

    - Have a **local version** on my machine and another version on the **cloud** so that i don't lose any progress or work by accident.

    - Have a place to work with my team effectively.
    - Be able to *manage* and *contol* what's **added**, **modified** or **deleted** from the project.

### Tools Comparison: 
1. ***Visual Studio Code(vs code)*** VS ***PyCharm***: 

|-|**Visual Studio Code**|**PyCharm**|
|-|------------------|-------|
|**Performance**|Keeps low memory consumption, increase memory consumption only when there are multiple tasks|Runs in full power which consumes a lot of memory|
|**Price**|Vs code is an open source software, meaning its cost free|PyCharm costs around $200 for the premium version,there is a free one but it lakes some functionalities|
|**Search**|Strong|average|
|**Code dependency management**|weak|Strong|

2. ***Linux*** VS ***Windows***:

|-|Linux|Windows|
|-|-----|-------|
|**Price**|Free open-source OP|licensed OP(it has a cost)|
|**Source-code accessibility**|accessible|inaccessible|
|**Kernel**|Monolithic kernel(high space and efficiency )|micro-kernel(low space and efficiency )|
|**File system**|Tree structure|Directories/folders structure|
|**Security**|Multi-user architecture(more stable)|Single-user architecture(less stable)|
|**Ease of Use**|More appealing to professional users|More appealing to casual users|

3. ***GitHub*** VS ***GitLab***:

|-|GitHub|GitLab|
|-|------|------|
|**Price**|Projects are free and publicly open to all|
Repositories are only open to the team of collaborators|
|**Integration**|Provided by third-parties|Provides built-in integration|
|**Authentication**|Roles authenticat what can and can't be accessed|Developers have the authority to allow access or not allow it|
|**Platform**|Provides developers with a platform to store, manage and track projects|Provides web-based DevOps internal management of repositories|
|**Inner-sourcing**|Allowed|Not allowed|
